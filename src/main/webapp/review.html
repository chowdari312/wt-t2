           <p style="text-align: justify;" >NPTEL content is useful in filling the gap in learning. Here, one can learn from the best teachers in the country. For me NPTEL is the best platform for online learning since there is no prequalification, no age limit, and no entrance criteria to enrol. I feel myself privileged to be in the line of eminent learners from the world known organizations like ISRO, DRDO, Chennai Metro, and TCS etc.</p>
